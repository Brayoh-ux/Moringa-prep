    <h3>Today we are going to bake a simple white cake.</h3>
    <p>This cake was sent home from our children's school. It is the simplest, great tasting <br> cake I've ever made. Great to make with the kids, especially for cupcakes.</p>

        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>half cup butter</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 half cup all-purpose floor.</li>
        <li>1 ¾ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h5>Directions</h5>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br> Grease and flour a 9x9 inch pan or line a muffin pan with paper liners.</p><br>
    <p>In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. <br> Combine flour and baking powder, <br> add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Finally stir in the milk until batter is smooth. <br> Pour or spoon batter into the prepared pan.</p> <br>
